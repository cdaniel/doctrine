To achieve this, we needed to develop maps within government which requires an anchor (user need), an understanding of position (the value chain and components involved) and an understanding of movement (evolution). To begin with, the proposed governance system needed to clearly reflect user needs in all its decision-making processes. The users include not only departmental users but also the wider public who will interact with any services provided. It was essential, therefore, that those users’ needs were determined at the outset, represented in the creation of any proposal and any expected outcomes of any proposal are set against those needs. But this was not enough, we needed also the value chain that provided those user needs and how evolved the components were. Maps therefore became a critical part of the Governance structure."

What you want to avoid is taking exceptional people out of their role and putting them into something they are not suited to simply because they think that is the only way to progress. Leadership, management and engineering are all aptitudes, they are all valuable and they have to work in concert. If the hierarchy of your organisation uniformly reflects your pay scales then you're likely to be draining talent from where it should be and putting it into roles that it is not suited for. This is often done for arguments of \"responsibility\" or \"managing bigger teams\" (which also causes people to try and accumulate empires) or \"spreading experience\" or \"career path\" but there are alternative ways of achieving this than taking a gifted engineer and turning them into a mediocre project manager. This is probably one of the most difficult areas as ego is quickly encountered."

These can be powerful sensing engines (e.g. the ILC model) for future change as well as sources of co-operation with others along with defensive and offensive alliances. But ecosystems need management, they need tending as a gardener tends a garden - sometimes you allow them to grow wild, sometime you harvest, sometimes you help direct or constrain them. These are particular skills that you can develop but most important is the principle - listen to them.",
            "We viewed the existing centralized approach as problematic because it was often remote from the real needs of either public service employees, intermediaries or citizens alike. We envisaged a new engineering group that would work in the field and spot and then nurture opportunities for change at the frontline, working closely with service delivery providers."

A team of town planners then industrialise the product when appropriate forcing the settlers to move on.",
